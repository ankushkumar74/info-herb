        description: "A specific kind of flowering shrub is the rose. The Latin word Rosa is the source of its name. All roses were originally wild: they grew across North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many regions of Asia and Oceania. There are about 100 different species of roses. Although wild rose species can be produced in gardens, most garden roses are cultivars that have been selected by humans. The stems of most roses have spines. This is a typical plant defensive system. Roses can be found in abundance in gardens. They can also be found in vineyards. A rose bush is put at the end of each row of grapes in a large vineyard. The vine growers can tell that their vines are healthy as long as the roses are healthy. ",
        usesAndBenefits : "Roses have a pleasant smell. The aroma of the rose is produced by microscopic perfume glands on the petals, which may be seen under a strong microscope. Rose petals are sometimes dried and wrapped so that they can be used for decoration or perfume.Roses can be found in abundance in gardens. They can also be found in vineyards. A rose bush is put at the end of each row of grapes in a large vineyard. The vine growers can tell that their vines are healthy as long as the roses are healthy.",
        howToGrow : "Put the rose plant in the sun for 3 to 4 hours every morning so that it can grow at the proper period. Provide water to the plant as needed to ensure that there are no problems. This floral plant makes little use of chemical fertilisers or fertilisers.",

        description: "The Liliaceae family of plants is categorised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous blooming plants because they have simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The blossoms may appear as a single flower at the tip of the stalk, a cluster of flowers, or as an arrangement down the stem (inflorescence). The Northern Hemisphere's temperate zones make up the majority of the distribution of the Liliaceae. Southwest Asia to China is where the diversity is concentrated. They are found in a variety of habitats, including deciduous woodlands, Mediterranean scrub, arctic tundra, and grasslands, steppes, and alpine meadows. Some Liliaceae genera are widely cultivated in both private and public spaces.Lilies in particular, have significant symbolic and ornamental value and are frequently depicted in paintings and decorative arts. They are also a significant economic product. Several of their genera, Lilium in particular, endure substantial herbivory pressure from deer in various locations, both wild and tame.",
    
        usesAndBenefits : "The root, underground stem (rhizome), and dried flower tips are used to make medicine. Lily is used to treat heart issues such as heart failure and irregular heartbeat. It is also used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney stones, weak labour contractions, epilepsy, fluid retention (edoema), strokes with paralysis, eye infections (conjunctivitis), and leprosy.",
    
        howToGrow : "Loosen the soil 12 to 15 inches deep. Put the bulbs three times as deep as the bulb's height and pointy side up in the hole. Deep planting enables the developing stem to send out roots, which aid in plant stability and may remove the need for staking. After blooming, the flower stems can be cut back but leave the foliage until it browns and dies back to the ground completely. Bulbs gather energy for next year through the leaves."

        description: "Because of the structure of the root tubers in some Orchis species, the name orchid is derived from the Greek word (orchis) for testicle. These nonwoody perennial plants are mostly epiphytic or terrestrial herbs (i.e., growing on other plants rather than rooted in soil). Those that are linked to other plants are frequently vinelike, with a spongy root covering called the velamen that collects water from the surrounding air. Most species produce their own food, but some survive on dead organic matter (saprophytic) or rely on a fungus residing in their roots for nutrition. The orchid family is probably one of the most important of plant families from a horticultural point of view. Other than the horticultural uses to which orchids are put, the family is notably lacking in species from which products are derived. The only commercially important product derived from orchids is vanilla.",
    
        usesAndBenefits : "Orchids, which are high in vitamin A and antioxidants, will repair and rejuvenate your skin. It can be used to address skin issues such as wrinkles, blemishes, and more. To achieve that radiance, use orchid extract into your face mist or face pack.",
    
        howToGrow : "These plants do well in bright light, but not in direct late-afternoon sunlight (although dendrobiums can handle more sun). They also require high humidity and adequate circulation around the roots. They require repeated periods of drying followed by periods of intense watering. Orchids thrive in temperatures above 50 degrees Fahrenheit but below 85 degrees Fahrenheit.",

        description: "The tulip produces two or three thick bluish green leaves that are clustered at the base of the plant. The usually solitary bell-shaped flowers have three petals and three sepals. There are six free stamens, and the three-lobed ovary is terminated by a sessile three-lobed stigma. The fruit is a capsule with many seeds. Many garden tulips can be propagated only by their scaly bulbs. Tulip flowers occur in a wide range of colours except true blue—from purest white through all shades of yellow and red to brown and deepest purple to almost black. Almost 4,000 horticultural varieties have been developed from a number of species and hybrids. Generally, solid-coloured tulips are spoken of as “self-coloured,” while streaked blossoms are called “broken.” The phenomenon of colour streaks in tulips is due to a harmless virus infection that causes the self colour to disappear in certain zonal patterns, leaving the flower’s white or yellow underlying colour to show through in irregular streaks.",

        howToGrow : "Tulips thrive in most soil types, but prefer well-drained loam. In the autumn, the bulbs are frequently planted in compost-enriched soil at a depth of 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches). They will flower every year for a few years until dying. It is typical commercial practise to remove the bulbs once the blooms have finished blooming and the foliage has turned yellow, and the bulbs are then stored in a cool, dry spot until autumn replanting. Tulips are frequently pest-resistant in the garden.",

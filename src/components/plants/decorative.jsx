    decription: "'Tagetes' is the scientific name for marigold. One of the most frequently cultivated flowers in India is the marigold. This particular flower is incredibly beneficial and simple to grow. In Gujarati and Marwari, this flower is known as 'Galgota' and 'Hanjari Gajra', respectively. Annual marigold plants are grown all year long. Depending on the species, marigold foliage has a musky, pungent scent, though some varieties have been bred to be scentless. It is said to deter some common insect pests, as well as nematodes.[citation needed] Tagetes species — notably T. patula — are hence often used in companion planting for tomato, eggplant, chili pepper, tobacco, and potato.",
